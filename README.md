# Crowdfunding_ETL
Mini ETL Project by Oz Garip and Mirta Lucic

# Background
    In this project, Oz and me practiced building an ETL (extract, transform and load) to process crowdfunding data from Excel files. We extracted and transformed the data, created four CSV files, and then used the CSV files to create an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and a table schema. After creating tables in PostgreSQL, we impoerted all four CSV files into a PostgreSQL database.

# Resources used
- Jupyter Notebook
- PgAdmin 4
- QuickDBD

#Steps used
1. Extract and transform crowdfunding and contact data from Excel files
2. Create and export Category, Subcategory, Campaign, and Contact DataFrames and save as CSV files
3. Design an ERD and table schema for the database in QuickDBD
4. Export table schema from QuickDBD to PostgreSQL
5. Create and populate PostgreSQL database tables
